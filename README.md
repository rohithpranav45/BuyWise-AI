## Overview

StoreIQ is a data-driven intelligence platform built to empower Walmart store managers with the insights needed to navigate complex global supply chains and make smarter, more profitable procurement decisions. By combining real-time news sentiment analysis with supply chain intelligence, StoreIQ transforms reactive decision-making into proactive strategic advantage.

### The Problem: Navigating the Battlefield of Modern Retail

In today's global economy, retail supply chains are a high-stakes battlefield. Store managers are on the front lines, facing a constant barrage of challenges:

- **⚡ Volatile Tariffs**: Sudden international tariff hikes can instantly erase the profit margins of best-selling products
- **📈 Unpredictable Demand**: Consumer interest, driven by social media trends and news cycles, is more chaotic and harder to forecast than ever
- **💔 Information Silos**: Critical data on tariffs, inventory, and market sentiment is often disconnected, forcing managers to make high-impact decisions with an incomplete picture
- **⏰ Time Pressure**: Market windows demand immediate, informed decisions

This environment forces a reactive approach, leading to missed opportunities and unnecessary financial losses.

### Our Solution: StoreIQ - The Financial Co-Pilot 🎯

StoreIQ transforms this reactive battle into a proactive strategy. It's an intelligence platform that acts as a financial co-pilot for every store manager, translating complex global data into simple, actionable, and profitable recommendations.

We don't just show data; we provide a clear path forward, turning global market volatility into a local competitive advantage for Walmart.

## ✨ Key Features: A 360-Degree Intelligence Hub

StoreIQ guides the manager through a logical funnel of discovery, from a high-level overview to granular, actionable insights:

### 🌎 Interactive Command Center
An immersive map interface to select a store and immediately see which product departments require strategic attention.

### 💡 AI-Powered Recommendations  
Every product in the dashboard is tagged with a clear procurement directive powered by our backend decision engine.

### 💰 Tariff Impact & ROI Analysis
Our flagship component provides a side-by-side financial breakdown of sourcing options, crystallizing the benefit of a strategic pivot into a concrete Potential Profit Increase.

### 🗺️ Supply Chain Visualization
An interactive map that plots primary and alternative supply routes, color-coded by tariff risk.

### 📊 Core Factor Analysis
Transparent, at-a-glance cards that visualize the key metrics of Cost, Demand, and Urgency.

### 🔬 "What-If" Scenario Simulator
An empowering tool within the main dashboard that allows managers to stress-test the supply chain against future changes.

```

### Processing Steps

1. **📨 Request** (`frontend/src/api/client.js`): The React frontend sends a productID and storeID to the `/api/analyze` endpoint

2. **⚡ Parallel Processing** (`backend/app.py`): The Flask backend orchestrates several tasks in parallel:
   - **📰 Demand Analysis** (`news_service.py`): Fetches and analyzes news sentiment via NewsAPI and TextBlob
   - **🤖 ML-Powered Substitution** (`decision_service.py`): Identifies the best substitutes using a Scikit-learn cosine similarity model
   - **⚠️ Risk Analysis** (`decision_service.py`): Calculates urgency and cost scores based on static data and weather data

3. **🧠 Decision Engine** (`decision_service.py`): All data points are fed into a custom rule-based engine that determines the final recommendation and a human-readable "Decision Narrative"

4. **📊 Response & Visualization** (`DeeperAnalysisDashboard.js`): The engine's output and all supporting data are consolidated into a single JSON response. The React frontend receives this object and efficiently populates the entire dashboard
